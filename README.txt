	Add your bot to the desired discord server. (Instructions in above link)
	
	You will also need to download ffmpeg to the program folder. https://ffmpeg.org/download.html

USEAGE:
	
	Get whatever sound files you want (as a .WAV or .MP3) and put them in the Sounds folder inside of this directory.

	Run botMain.py located in this directory by opening a comand line and typing "cd [filepath]; python botMain.py" 
	where [filepath is replaced by the filepath to this folder]
